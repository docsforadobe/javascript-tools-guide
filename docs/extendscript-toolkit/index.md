# The ExtendScript Toolkit

!!! warning
    The Extendscript Toolkit has been deprecated in favour of [The VS Code Debugger](../vscode-debugger/index.md#the-vscode-debugger)!

This information is preserved here for legacy reference, but the Extendscript Toolkit is no longer being actively maintained or supported, and will no longer work on 64-bit-only versions of MacOS.

The ExtendScript Toolkit provides an interactive development and testing environment for ExtendScript in all JavaScript-enabled Adobe applications.

It includes a full-featured, syntax-highlighting text editor with Unicode capabilities and multiple undo/redo support. The Toolkit is the default editor for ExtendScript files, which use the extension .jsx.

The Toolkit includes a JavaScript debugger that allows you to:

- Single-step through JavaScript scripts (JS or JSX files) inside an application.
- Inspect all data for a running script.
- Set and execute breakpoints.

When you double click a JSX file in the platform's windowing environment, the script runs in the Toolkit, unless it specifies a particular target application using the #target directive.

For more information, see [Selecting a debugging target](debugging-in-the-toolkit.md#selecting-a-debugging-target) and [Preprocessor directives](../extendscript-tools-features/preprocessor-directives.md).
