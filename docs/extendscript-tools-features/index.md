# ExtendScript Tools and Features

In addition to the specific functional modules and development tools, ExtendScript provides these tools
and features:

- Global objects that support debugging and object inspection; these include the [Dollar ($) object](dollar-object.md) and
  the [ExtendScript reflection interface](extendscript-reflection-interface.md).
- A localization utility for providing user-interface string values in different languages. See [Localizing ExtendScript strings](localizing-extendscript-strings.md).
- Global functions for displaying short messages in dialog boxes. See User notification dialogs.
- An object type for specifying measurement values together with their units. See [Specifying measurement values](specifying-measurement-values.md).
- [Preprocessor directives](preprocessor-directives.md) that allow you to include scripts in one another and specify an execution
  target application.
- Support for extending or overriding math and logical operator behavior on a class-by-class basis. See
  [Operator overloading](operator-overloading.md).

ExtendScript also provides a common scripting environment for all Adobe JavaScript-enabled
applications, and allows interapplication communication through scripts.

For information on these features, see [Interapplication Communication with Scripts](../interapplication-communication/index.md#interapplication-communication-with-scripts).
