Operator overloading
====================
ExtendScript allows you to extend or override the behavior of a math or a Boolean operator for a specific
class by defining a method in that class with same name as the operator. For example, this code defines
the addition (+) operator for the class ``MyClass``. In this case, the addition operator simply adds the operand
to the property value::

    // define the constructor method
    function MyClass (initialValue) {
        this.value = initialValue;
    }

    // define the addition operator
    MyClass.prototype ["+"] = function (operand) {
        return this.value + operand;
    }

This allows you to perform the "+" operation with any object of this class::

    var obj = new MyClass (5);
    Result: [object Object]
    obj + 10;
    Result: 15

You can override the following operators:

======  =============
Unary   ``+, ~``
Binary  ``+, *, /, %, ^``
        ``<, <=, ==``
        ``<<, >>, >>>``
        ``&, |, ===``
======  =============

- The operators ``>`` and ``>=`` are implemented by executing NOT operator ``<=`` and NOT operator ``<``.
- Combined assignment operators such as ``*=`` are not supported.

All operator overload implementations must return the result of the operation. To perform the default
operation, return ``undefined``.

Unary operator functions work on the ``this`` object, while binary operators work on the ``this`` object and
the first argument. The + and - operators have both unary and binary implementations. If the first
argument is undefined, the operator is unary; if it is supplied, the operator is binary.

For binary operators, a second argument indicates the order of operands. For noncommutative operators,
either implement both order variants in your function or return ``undefined`` for combinations that you do
not support. For example::

    this ["/"] = function (operand, rev) {
        if (rev) {
            // do not resolve operand / this
            return;
        } else {
            // resolve this / operand
            return this.value / operand;
    }
