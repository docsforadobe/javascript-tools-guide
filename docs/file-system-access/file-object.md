.. _file-object:

File object
===========
Represents a file in the local file system in a platform-independent manner. All properties and methods
resolve file system aliases automatically and act on the original file unless otherwise noted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _file-object-constructors:

File object constructors
------------------------
To create a File object, use the File function or the new operator. The constructor accepts full or partial
path names, and returns the new object. The CRLF sequence for the file is preset to the system default, and
the encoding is preset to the default system encoding.

::

    File ( [ path ] ); // Can return a Folder object
    new File ([ path ] ); // Always returns a File object

======== ==============================================================================================
``path`` Optional. The absolute or relative path to the file associated with this object, specified in
         platform-specific or URI format; see :ref:`specifying-paths`. The value stored in the
         object is the absolute path.

         The path need not refer to an existing file. If not supplied, a temporary name is generated.

         If the path refers to an existing folder:

         - The File function returns a Folder object instead of a File object.
         - The new operator returns a File object for a nonexisting file with the same name.

======== ==============================================================================================

.. warning:: In After Effects on MacOS, if ``path.length`` is more than 1002, After Effects crashes.
  This has been reported on MacOS 10.11.6 and After Effects 13.8 and 14.0.

File object properties
----------------------
These properties are available for ``File`` objects.

================== ======= ==========================================================================================
**absoluteURI**    String  The full path name for the referenced file in URI notation. Read only.
**alias**          Boolean When true, the object refers to a file system alias or shortcut. Read only.
**created**        Date    The creation date of the referenced file, or null if the object does not
                           refer to a file on disk. Read only.
**creator**        String  In Mac OS, the file creator as a four-character string. In Windows or UNIX,
                           value is "????". Read only.
**displayName**    String  The localized name of the referenced file, without the path. Read only.
**encoding**       String  Gets or sets the encoding for subsequent read/write operations. One of
                           the encoding constants listed in :ref:`file-and-folder-supported-encoding-names`.
                           If the value is not recognized, uses the system default encoding.

                           A special encoder, BINARY, is used to read binary files. It stores each byte
                           of the file as one Unicode character regardless of any encoding. When
                           writing, the lower byte of each Unicode character is treated as a single
                           byte to write.

**eof**            Boolean When true, a read attempt caused the current position to be at the end of
                           the file, or the file is not open. Read only.
**error**          String  A message describing the last file system error; see :ref:`file-access-error-messages`.
                           Typically set by the file system, but a script can set
                           it. Setting this value clears any error message and resets the error bit for
                           opened files. Contains the empty string if there is no error.
**exists**         Boolean When true, this object refers to a file or file-system alias that actually
                           exists in the file system. Read only.
**fsName**         String  The platform-specific full path name for the referenced file. Read only.
**fullName**       String  The full path name for the referenced file in URI notation. Read only.
**hidden**         Boolean When true, the file is not shown in the platform-specific file browser.
                           Read/write. If the object references a file-system alias or shortcut, the flag
                           is altered on the alias, not on the original file.
**length**         Number  The size of the file in bytes. Can be set only for a file that is not open, in
                           which case it truncates or pads the file with 0-bytes to the new length.
**lineFeed**       String  How line feed characters are written in the file system. One of:
                           ``Windows`` - Windows style
                           ``Macintosh`` - Mac OS style
                           ``Unix`` - UNIX style
**localizedName**  String  A localized version of the file name portion of the absolute URI for the
                           referenced file, without the path specification. Read only.
**modified**       Date    The date of the referenced file's last modification, or null if the object
                           does not refer to a file on disk. Read only.
**name**           String  The file name portion of the absolute URI for the referenced file, without
                           the path specification. Read only.
**parent**         Folder  The Folder object for the folder that contains this file. Read only.
**path**           String  The path portion of the absolute URI for the referenced file, without the
                           file name. Read only.
**readonly**       Boolean When true, prevents the file from being altered or deleted. If the
                           referenced file is a file-system alias or shortcut, the flag is altered on the
                           alias, not on the original file.
**relativeURI**    String  The path name for the referenced file in URI notation, relative to the
                           current folder. Read only.
**type**           String  The file type as a four-character string.

                           - In Mac OS, the Mac OS file type.
                           - In Windows, ``"appl"`` for ``.EXE`` files, ``"shlb"`` for ``.DLL`` files and ``"TEXT"``
                             for any other file.

                           If the file does not exist, the value is "????". Read only.

==========  ===================================================================
``target``  A string with the URI path to the target location, or a File object
            that references the target location.
==========  ===================================================================

Copies this object's referenced file to the specified target location. Resolves any aliases to find the
source file. If a file exists at the target location, it is overwritten.

Returns true if the copy was successful, false otherwise.

.. _file-createAlias:

createAlias()
*************
``fileObj.createAlias( [path] )``

========  ================================================
``path``  A string containing the path of the target file.
========  ================================================

Makes this file a file-system alias or shortcut to the specified file. The referenced file for this object
must not yet exist on disk.

Returns true if the operation was successful, false otherwise.


.. _file-execute:

execute()
*********
``fileObj.execute()``

Opens this file using the appropriate application, as if it had been double-clicked in a file browser.
You can use this method to run scripts, launch applications, and so on.

Returns true immediately if the application launch was successful.

.. _file-getRelativeURI:

getRelativeURI()
****************
``fileObj.getRelativeURI( [basePath] )``

============  =================================================================
``basePath``  Optional. A string containing the base path for the relative URI.
              Default is the current folder.
============  =================================================================

Retrieves the URI for this file, relative to the specified base path, in URI notation. If no base path is
supplied, the URI is relative to the path of the current folder.

Returns a string containing the relative URI.

.. _file-open:

open()
******
``fileObj.open( mode [,type] [,creator] )``

========  ==========================================================================
``mode``  A string indicating the read/write mode. One of:
            - ``r``: (read) Opens for reading. If the file does not exist
              or cannot be found, the call fails.
            - ``w``: (write) Opens a file for writing. If the file exists,
              its contents are destroyed. If the file does not exist,
              creates a new, empty file.
            - ``e``: (edit) Opens an existing file for reading and writing.
            - ``a``: (append) Opens the file in Append mode, and moves the
              current position to the end of the file.

              a 4-character string. Ignored in Windows and UNIX.
========  ==========================================================================

Opens the referenced file for subsequent read/write operations. The method resolves any aliases to
find the file.

Returns true if the file has been opened successfully, false otherwise.

The method attempts to detect the encoding of the open file. It reads a few bytes at the current
location and tries to detect the Byte Order Mark character 0xFFFE. If found, the current position is
advanced behind the detected character and the encoding property is set to one of the strings
UCS-2BE, UCS-2LE, UCS4-BE, UCS-4LE, or UTF-8. If the marker character is not found, it checks for
zero bytes at the current location and makes an assumption about one of the above formats (except
UTF-8). If everything fails, the encoding property is set to the system encoding.

.. note:: Be careful about opening a file more than once. The operating system usually permits you to
  do so, but if you start writing to the file using two different File objects, you can destroy your data.

                     should be included in the display, false if it should not.
``multiSelect``  Optional. Boolean. When true, the user can select multiple files and the return value is an array. Default is false.
===============  ====================================================================================================================

Opens the built-in platform-specific file-browsing dialog, in which the user can select an existing file
or files, and creates new File objects to represent the selected files. Differs from the class method
openDialog() in that it presets the current folder to this File object's parent folder and the current
file to this object's associated file.

If the user clicks **OK**, returns a File or Folder object for the selected file or folder, or an array of
objects. If the user cancels, returns ``null``.

readln()
********
``fileObj.readln()``

Reads a single line of text from the file at the current position, and returns it in a string. Line feeds
are recognized as CR, LF, CRLF, or LFCR pairs. If the file is encoded, multiple bytes might be read to
create single Unicode characters.

Returns a string that contains the text.

.. _file-remove:

remove()
********
``fileObj.remove()``

Deletes the file associated with this object from disk, immediately, without moving it to the system
trash. Does not resolve aliases; instead, deletes the referenced alias or shortcut file itself.

.. note:: Cannot be undone. It is recommended that you prompt the user for permission before deleting.

Returns true if the file is deleted successfully.

.. _file-rename:

rename()
********
``fileObj.rename( newName )``

===========  ================================

            Not used in Mac OS.

            .. note::
               - Separate expression with a semicolon (``;``) to filter by all these types at once; (show ``jsx`` AND ``all``)
               - separate with a comma (``,``) to populate the filter dropdown, to select one type at a time (show ``jsx`` OR ``all``)

==========  ===================================================================================

Opens the built-in platform-specific file-browsing dialog, in which the user can select an existing file
location to which to save information, and creates a new File object to represent the selected file.

Differs from the class method :ref:`file-saveDialog` in that it presets the current folder to this File object's
parent folder and the file to this object's associated file.

If the user clicks **OK**, returns a File object for the selected file. If the user cancels, returns ``null``.

.. _file-seek:

seek()
******
``fileObj.seek( pos[, mode] )``

Unicode character may write multiple bytes.

.. note:: Be careful not to write to a file that is open in another application or object, as this can
  overwrite existing data.

Returns true on success.

.. _file-writeln:

writeln()
*********
``fileObj.writeln (text[, text...]...)``

========  =============================================================================
``text``  One or more strings to write, which are concatenated to form a single string.
