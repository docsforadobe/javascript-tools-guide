# File System Access

Adobe ExtendScript defines classes that simplify cross-platform file-system access. These classes are
available to all applications that support a JavaScript interface.

- The first part of this chapter, [Using File and Folder objects](using-file-and-folder-objects.md#using-file-and-folder-objects), describes how to use these classes and
  provides details of pathname syntax.
- [File object](file-object.md#file-object) and [Folder object](folder-object.md#folder-object) provide reference details of the objects,
  properties, methods, and creation parameters. You can also choose the Core JavaScript Classes
  dictionary from the Help menu in the ExtendScript Toolkit to inspect the objects in the Object Model
  Viewer.
