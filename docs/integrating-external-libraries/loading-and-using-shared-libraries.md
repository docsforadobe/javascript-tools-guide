Loading and using shared libraries
==================================
To load an external shared library into JavaScript, create a new :ref:`externalobject-object`. The instance acts as
a container and manager for the JavaScript interface to the library. It provides a logging facility that prints
status information to the JavaScript Console in the ExtendScript Toolkit, to help you debug your external
library use.

Once the library has been loaded, its exported symbols become available to JavaScript. In your JavaScript
code, you can call the functions defined in the library directly in the ``ExternalObject`` instance, or indirectly
through library-defined object types.

- **Direct access to library calls through the ExternalObject instance** - Use the direct-access style
  for C-language libraries. For each function defined in the C library, there is a corresponding method in
  the ExternalObject object. You can pass data to these methods and receive the return value directly.

  For example::

    mylib = new ExternalObject ("lib:" + samplelib); // load the library
    alert(mylib.version) ;
    // access functions directly from ExternalObject instance
    var a = mylib.method_abc(1,2.0,true, "this is data") ;
    alert(a) ;
    mylib.unload() ;

    For details of how to define functions for direct access through the ExternalObject object, see
    :ref:`defining-entry-points-for-direct-access`.

- **Indirect access to library calls through JavaScript classes** - Use the indirect style to access classes
  defined in a C++ library. For each C++ class defined in the library, a corresponding JavaScript class is automatically defined,
  and you can access the properties and methods through an instance of that class. For example::

    anotherlib= new ExternalObject ("lib:" + filespec); // load the library
    alert(anotherlib.version) ;
    // instantiate library-defined class
    var myObject = new MyNewClass() ;
    // access functions from instance
    var a = myObject.method_abc(1,2.0,true,"this is data") ;
    alert(a) ;
    anotherlib.unload() ;

    :ref:`defining-entry-points-for-indirect-access`.
