.. _bridgetalk-class:

BridgeTalk class
================
Static properties and methods of this class provide a way for your script to determine basic messaging
system information before you create any specific message objects. Static methods allow you to check if
an application is installed and is already running, and to launch the application. A callback defined on the
class determines how the application processes incoming messages.

You can access static properties and methods in the BridgeTalk class, which is available in the global
namespace. For example::

  var thisApp = BridgeTalk.appName;

.. note:: You must instantiate the BridgeTalk class to create the BridgeTalk message object, which is used
  to send message packets between applications. Dynamic properties and methods can be accessed only in
  instances.

.. _bridgetalk-class-properties:

BridgeTalk class properties
---------------------------
The BridgeTalk class provides these static properties, which are available in the global namespace:

.. _bridgetalk-appinstance:

appInstance
***********
Type: ``String``

The instance identifier of an application launched by the messaging
framework, the instance portion of an application specifier; see
:ref:`application-specifiers`.

Used only for those applications, such as InDesign, that support launching
and running multiple instances.

Read only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _bridgetalk-applocale:

appLocale
*********
Type: ``String``

The locale of this application, the locale portion of an application
specifier; see :ref:`application-specifiers`. When a message is
sent, this is the locale of the sending application.

Read only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _bridgetalk-appname:

appName
*******
Type: ``String``

The name of this application, the appname portion of an application
specifier; see :ref:`application-specifiers`. When a message is
sent, this is the name of the sending application.

Read only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _bridgetalk-appspecifier:

appSpecifier
************
Type: ``String``

A lower-case string containing the complete specifier for this application;
see :ref:`application-specifiers`.

Read/write.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _bridgetalk-appstatus:

appStatus
*********
Type: ``String``

The current processing status of this application. One of:

- ``busy``: The application is currently busy, but not processing messages. This is the case, for example, when a modal dialog is shown.
- ``idle``: The application is currently idle, but processes messages regularly.
- ``not installed``: The application is not installed.

Read only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _bridgetalk-appversion:

appVersion
**********
Type: ``String``

The version number of this application, the version portion of an
application specifier; see :ref:`application-specifiers`. When a
message is sent, this is the version of the sending application.

Read only.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _bridgetalk-onreceive:

onReceive
*********
Type: ``Function``

A callback function that this application applies to unsolicited incoming
messages. The default function evaluates the body of the received
message and returns the result of evaluation. To change the default
behavior, set this to a function definition in the following form::

  BridgeTalk.onReceive = function( bridgeTalkObject ) {
  // act on received message
  };

The body property of the received message object contains the received
data. The function can return any type. See :ref:`handling-unsolicited-messages`.

.. note:: This function is not applied to a message that is received in response
  to a message sent from this application. Response messages are processed
  by the onResult, onReceived, or onError callbacks associated with the
  sent message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


.. _bridgetalk-class-functions:

BridgeTalk class functions
--------------------------

The BridgeTalk class provides these static methods, which are available in the global namespace:

             most recent version. If negative, returns the highest version up to and including the
             absolute value.

             If a major version is specified, returns the highest minor-version variation. For
             example, if Photoshop CS versions 9, 9.1, and 10 are installed::

              BridgeTalk.Specifier( "photoshop", "9" )
               => ["photoshop-9.1"]
``locale``   Optional. The specific locale to search for.

===========  =======================================================================================

Retrieves a complete application specifier.
Returns a complete specifier (see :ref:`application-specifiers`) for a messaging-enabled
application version installed on this computer, or null if the requested version of the application is
not installed.

For example, assuming installed applications include Photoshop CS4 11.0 ``en_us``, Photoshop CS2
8.5 ``de_de``, Photoshop CS2 9.0 ``de_de``, and Photoshop CS2 9.5 ``de_de``, and that the current locale is
``en_US`` ::

  BridgeTalk.getSpecifier ("photoshop");
   => ["photoshop-11.0-en_us"]

  BridgeTalk.getSpecifier ("photoshop", 0, "en_us");
    => ["photoshop-11.0-en_us"]

  BridgeTalk.getSpecifier ("photoshop", 0, "de_de");
    => ["photoshop-9.5-de_de"]

  BridgeTalk.getSpecifier ("photoshop", -9.2, "de_de");
    => ["photoshop-9.0-de_de"]

.. _bridgetalk-gettargets:

getTargets()
************
``BridgeTalk.getTargets ([version],[locale])``

===========  =======================================================================================
``version``  Optional. The specific version number to search for, or ``null`` to return the most
             appropriate version (matching, most recent, or running), with version information.
             Specify only a major version number to return the highest minor-version
             variation.

             For example, if Photoshop CS versions 9, 9.5, and 10 are installed::

              BridgeTalk.getTargets( "9" )
                => [photoshop-9.5]

             Specify a negative value to return all versions up to the absolute value of the

===========  =======================================================================================

Retrieves a list of messaging-enabled applications installed on this computer.
Returns an array of :ref:`application-specifiers`.

- If version is supplied, specifiers include the base name plus the version information.
- If locale is supplied, specifiers include the full name, with both version and locale information.
- If neither version nor locale is supplied, returns base specifiers with neither version nor locale
  information, but tries to find the most appropriate version and locale; see :ref:`application-specifiers`.

For example, assuming installed applications include Photoshop CS3 10.0 ``en_US``, Photoshop CS4
11.0 ``en_us``, and Illustrator CS4 14.0 ``de_de`` ::

  BridgeTalk.getTargets();
    => [photoshop,illustrator]

  BridgeTalk.getTargets( "10.0" );
    => [photoshop-10.0]

  BridgeTalk.getTargets( null );
    => [photoshop-11.0, illustrator-14.0]

  BridgeTalk.getTargets( null, "en_US" );
    => [photoshop-10.0-en_US, photoshop-11.0-en_US]

  BridgeTalk.getTargets( null, null );
    => [photoshop-10.0-en_US, photoshop-11.0-en_us, illustrator-14.0-de_de]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _bridgetalk-isrunning:

isRunning()

               not brought to the front of the screen.
=============  =======================================================================================

Launches the given application on the local computer. It is not necessary to launch an application
explicitly in order to send it a message; sending a message to an application that is not running
automatically launches it.

Returns ``true`` if the application has already been launched, ``false`` if it was launched by this call.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _bridgetalk-loadappscript:

loadAppScript()
***************
``BridgeTalk.loadAppScript (specifier)``

=============  =======================================================================================

implement late loading of startup scripts.

Returns ``true`` if the script was successfully loaded.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _bridgetalk-ping:

ping()
******
``BridgeTalk.ping (specifier, pingRequest)``

===============  =======================================================================================
``specifier``    A specifier for the target application; see :ref:`application-specifiers`.
``pingRequest``  An identifying key string for a specific type of return value. One of:

===============  =======================================================================================

Sends a message to another application to determine whether it can be contacted.

Returns a string whose meaning is defined by the ping-request key.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _bridgetalk-pump:

pump()
******
``BridgeTalk.pump ()``

Checks all active messaging interfaces for outgoing and incoming messages, and processes them if
there are any.

.. note:: Most applications have a message processing loop that continually checks the message queues,
  so use of this method is rarely required.

Returns ``true`` if any messages have been processed, ``false`` otherwise.
