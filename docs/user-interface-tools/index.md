User-Interface Tools
====================
Adobe provides the ScriptUI component, which works with the ExtendScript JavaScript interpreter to
provide JavaScript scripts with the ability to create and interact with user interface elements. It provides an
object model for windows and user-interface control elements within an Adobe application.

- The first part of this chapter describes the features and programming model, with details of how you
  can use JavaScript to build a user interface with ScriptUI objects.

- :ref:`scriptui-object-reference` provides reference details of the objects, properties, methods,
  and creation parameters. You can also choose the ScriptUI Classes dictionary from the Help menu in
  the ExtendScript Toolkit to inspect the objects in the Object Model Viewer.
