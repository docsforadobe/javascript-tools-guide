Size and location objects
=========================
ScriptUI defines objects to represent the complex values of properties that place and size windows and
user-interface elements. These objects cannot be created directly, but are created when you set the
corresponding property. That property then returns that object. For example, the ``bounds`` property returns
a ``Bounds`` object.

You can set these properties as objects, strings, or arrays.

- ``e.prop = Object`` - The object must contain the set of properties defined for this type, as shown in
  the table below. The properties have integer values.
- ``e.prop = String`` - The string must be an executable JavaScript inline object declaration,
  conforming to the same object description.
- ``e.prop = Array`` - The array must have integer coordinate values in the order defined for this type,
  as shown in the table below. For example:

The following examples show equivalent ways of placing a 380 by 390 pixel window near the upper left
corner of the screen::

    var dlg = new Window( "dialog", "Alert Box Builder ");
    dlg.bounds = { x:100, y:100, width:380, height:390 }; // Object
    dlg.bounds = { left:100, top:100, right:480, bottom:490 }; // Object
    dlg.bounds = "x:100, y:100, width:380, height:390"; // String
    dlg.bounds = "left:100, top:100, right:480, bottom:490"; // String
    dlg.bounds = [100, 100, 480, 490]; // Array

You can access the resulting object as an array with values in the order defined for the type, or as an object
with the properties supported for the type.

Size and location object types
------------------------------
The following table shows the property-value object types, the element properties that create and contain
them, and their array and object-property formats.

.. _bounds:

Bounds
******
Defines the boundaries of a window within the screen's coordinate space, or of a
user-interface element within the container's coordinate space. Contains an array, [left,
top, right, bottom], that defines the coordinates of the upper left and lower right
corners of the element.

A ``Bounds`` object is created when you set an element's ``bounds`` property, and this property
returns a ``Bounds`` object.

- An object must contain properties named ``left``, ``top``, ``right``, ``bottom``,
  or ``x``, ``y``, ``width``, ``height``.
- An array must have values in the order [left, top, right, bottom].

.. _dimension:

Dimension
*********
Defines the size of a Window or user-interface element. Contains an array, ``[ width, height ]``,
that defines the element's size in pixels.

A ``Dimension`` object is created when you set an element's size or ``preferredSize``
property. (A ``preferredSize`` of -1 causes the size to be calculated automatically.)

- An object must contain properties named ``width`` and ``height``.
- An array must have values in the order ``[ width, height ]``.

.. _margins:

Margins
*******
Defines the number of pixels between the edges of a container and its outermost child
elements. Contains an array ``[ left, top, right, bottom ]`` whose elements define the
margins between the left edge of a container and its leftmost child element, and so on.

A ``Margins`` object is created when you set an element's ``margins`` property.

- An object must contain properties named ``left``, ``top``, ``right``, and ``bottom``.
- An array must have values in the order [ ``left``, ``top``, ``right``, ``bottom`` ].

You can also set the margins property to a number; all of the array values are then set to
this number.

.. _point:

Point
*****
Defines the location of a ``Window`` or user-interface element. Contains an array, ``[ x, y ]``,
whose values represent the origin point of the element as horizontal and vertical pixel
offsets from the origin of the element's coordinate space.

A ``Point`` object is created when you set an element's location property.

- An object must contain properties named ``x`` and ``y``.
- An array must have values in the order ``[ x, y ]``.
