The VS Code Debugger
====================

Since :ref:`the-extendscript-toolkit` has been deprecated by Adobe (in part due to MacOS dropping support for 32-bit apps), the official method of debugging Extendscript is by using `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ with the `Adobe Extendscript extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Adobe.extendscript-debug>`_.

It's semi-buggy, generally unreliable, and seems to be meant for self-contained instant-run scripts (as opposed to ScriptUI panels), but it can be helpful in some cases.

The docs here are currently in progress and are ever-evolving; contributions are encouraged and welcome!
